# Fellowship.ai-Food-101-Challenge

Food-101 is a challenging vision problem, but everyone can relate to it.  Recent SoTA is ~80% top-1, 90% top-5.  These approaches rely on lots of TTA, large networks and  even novel architectures.

Train a decent model >85% accuracy for top-1 for the test set, using a ResNet50 or smaller network with a reasonable set of augmentations.

There's a story behind every dataset and here's your opportunity to share yours.

Content:
This is the Food 101 dataset, also available from https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_extra/food-101/

It contains images of food, organized by type of food. It was used in the Paper "Food-101 â€“ Mining Discriminative Components with Random Forests" by Lukas Bossard, Matthieu Guillaumin and Luc Van Gool. It's a good (large dataset) for testing computer vision techniques.
